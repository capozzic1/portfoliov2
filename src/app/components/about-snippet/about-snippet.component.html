      <h2 class="text-center">My story</h2>
      <p class="about-body mx-auto">After graduating from UNLV in 2013, I started my career doing technical support for businesses where I would help business owners troubleshoot their internet, telephone, or video service. After almost 3 years of technical support, I was ready for
        a new experience. So I went abroad to teach English in South Korea. This was a remarkable experience that I'll never forget. It gave me a new perspective on life. While I teaching English, I also became passionate about my hobby of making web
        applications and coding. At the start of 2016, I started to put more time into studying web development via multiple online course platforms such as Udacity.com, freecodecamp.com, codeacademy.com, and codeschool.com. Now I am here in late 2017
        with more than 20 personal projects in my github account. Upon re-entry to the US, I hope to become an asset in the field of web development.</p>
